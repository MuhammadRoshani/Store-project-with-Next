          <h4>The best Windows laptops come in all shapes and sizes</h4>
          <p>
            You'll find a number of Copilot Plus PCs among my favorite Windows
            PCs. Two have an Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon X and deliver strong
            application and AI performance along with exceedingly long battery
            life. I love the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 for its slick and sturdy
            design and awesome haptic touchpad. The Asus Zenbook A14 is a winner
            for its ultralight yet rigid enclosure and the OLED display it
            supplies for the price, and the HP OmniBook 5 14 has the longest
            battery life of any laptop CNET has ever tested. Meanwhile, the
            Intel-based Acer Aspire 14 AI is a great budget option. Keep reading

            shapes and sizes If you aren't ready to take the plunge with a
            Snapdragon X series processor and worry about potential
            Windows-on-Arm compatibility issues, then I have Intel- and
            AMD-based favorites, from budget models and two-in-one convertibles
            to high-powered laptops for gamers and creators. And many of the
            best Windows laptops I've tested this year are at or nearest their
            lowest prices of the year for the holiday shopping season. With
            decades of experience testing and reviewing laptops, my colleagues
            and I conduct performance testing under controlled conditions in the
            CNET labs and perform extensive hands-on tests to assess the design,
            features and performance of each laptop we review. You'll find a
            good number of recommendations here but I also have more specific
            picks in different categories, starting with the best overall
            laptop, the best gaming laptop, best cheap gaming laptop, best
            laptop for college students and best two-in-one laptop. If you
            narrowed it to a specific brand, check out our picks for the best
            Asus laptop, best Dell laptop, best HP laptop and best Lenovo
            laptop. Beyond Windows, I have recommendations for the best MacBook
            and best Chromebook.The Surface Laptop 7 reverses earlier Arm-based
            efforts that were plagued by lackluster performance and limited
            compatibility. Many x86 apps were unable to run on an Arm-based
            system. This time around, performance has improved and so has
            compatibility.
